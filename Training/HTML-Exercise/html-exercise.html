I want to know how to prepare for that as a foreign student. For example, what kind of English test is required for entrance? How many courses does a student have to take each term? How much do I have to pay for the courses? How much do I need for food and housing? Really a long list of questions.  Since I know very little about American Universities, it would be great if you can suggest some universities suitable for me.  I’m looking forward to your reply. Thank you very much. </p>

<h1>范文</h1>

<h2>第一篇： 金钱是一切吗？</h2>
<p>In Money Everything?</p>
<p>I don't think money is everything, but we can't do without it. Fox example, money can't buy us happiness and a good education. And for another example, money can't buy us good health and a long life. But we can not live without money. We need it for our daily necessities such as food, clothes and transportation. What's more, we need it to live a better life. In short, we should learn the value of money and make the most of its advantages.</p>

<h2>第二篇：</h2>
<ol>
	<li>一些人喜欢住在城市，因为城市生活有许多便利。</li>
	<li>但有些人喜欢住在农村。 </li>
	<li>我认为，…… </li>
</ol>
<p>Where to live —in the City or in the Country </p>
<p>Some people like living in the city because city life has many advantages. They think there are more job opportunities in cities, life there is more colorful and meaningful than that in the country, and there are more modern conveniences in cities for people to enjoy. </p>
<p>But some other people prefer to live in the countryside. They say life in the countryside is closer to nature and better for their health, life there is quieter and that country people are more honest than city people. </p>
<p>I would like to live in a city when I am young to earn enough money and I live in the countryside when I am old for having a quite life. </p>

<h2>第三篇：</h2>
<p>你叫李平，是英语系学生会主席。写一封信给王教授，请他做一个有关中国历史的报告。注意信中要包括目的、时间、日期和地点。</p>
<p>May 19，2002 </p>
<p>Dear Professor Wang： </p>
<p>On behalf of the Student Union of the English Department, I am writing to invite you to give a lecture on Chinese history. We have planned to have such a lecture at 2：30 p. m. in Lecture Hall 419, on May 25. </p>
<p>Looking forward to your lecture. Inform us in advance if you can not come. </p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p> Li Ping </p>
    
<h2>第四篇： 男女应该平等吗？</h2>                                                    
<p>Should Men and Women Be Equal？</p>                  
<p>People have different ideas this issue, Some people say that men are superior to women in ability because men are physically stronger, do most of the hard labor in the world and hold most important positions. Other people believe that women have the ability to compete with men. There have been many famous women state leaders and great scientists in the world. We should fully carry out the principle "to each according to his work" so that the enthusiasm of both men and women for work can be fully aroused.</p>

<h2>第五篇： </h2>
<ol>
	<li>在中国，自行车是最为流行的交通工具。 </li>
	<li>骑自行车有许多好处。</li>
	<li>自行车的未来…… </li>
</ol>
<p>The Bicycle in China </p>
<p>The bicycle is the most popular means of transportation in China. China is a country "on bicycle wheels". People ride them for various purposes such as going to and from school and work. Bicycles are very cheap and easy to buy in China. </p>
<p>There are many advantages to riding a bicycle. First, using a bicycle can greatly help reduce the air pollution in many big cities. Second, people can improve their health by riding a bicycle. </p>	
<p>The future of bicycle will be bright. In some European countries, city governments have arranged pedestrians to use "public bicycles" to travel round the city center free of charge. </p>

<h2>第六篇：</h2>
<p>你是Helen，要写一封信给Julie，对她和她的丈夫昨日请你和你丈夫吃饭表示感谢，表示要回请他们，以答谢他们的盛情款待。</p>
<p>Dear Julie: </p>
<p>Thank you very much for the dinner that you invited my husband and I to yesterday. The food not only looked and smelled fabulous but tasted great, and my husband and I enjoyed it very much. Therefore, we would like to invite you to dinner at 7 p.m. this Friday at the Northwest Chinese restaurant to return your kindness and hospitality. </p>
<p>Please do come.</p> 
<p>Yours,</p> 
<p>Helen </p>                                                 

<h2>第七篇：</h2>
<ol>
	<li>假冒伪劣商品是个严重问题。</li>
	<li>一些原因导致了这种现象。</li>
	<li>为了扫除假冒伪劣商品，…… </li>
</ol>
<p>Fake Commodities </p>
<p>Fake and poor quality commodities are a serious problem. Many things can be faked such as soybean sauce， vinegar, bicycles， and many other things. The interests of consumers are affected, and many enterprises keep losing money because of cheap fake commodities. </p>
<p>There are some reasons for such a phenomenon. The major one is the desire of some people to "make easy money". These people think nothing of the law of the protection of intellectual property rights. </p>
<p>To get rid of fake and poor quality commodities, the government should educate people to obey the law of the protection of individual intellectual property rights and not to sell any fake goods. The government should punish severely and close down all the factories producing fake goods. </p>

<h2>第八篇：</h2>
<p>你是Alice。你的的朋友Bonnie很快就要到你的乡间小屋拜访，但你却要出去一会儿。留一张便条给她，告诉她食品在哪儿，告诉她一个人在屋里时应注意些什么。</p>
<p>May 18, 2002</p> 
<p>Dear Bonnie：</p> 
<p>I will be away for a while. The key to the cottage is under the doormat, and the food is in the refrigerator. After entering the house, lock the door from inside at once. The cottage is far away from the nearest town, and the area is not quite safe from burglars. So I think the saying is right "Where there is precaution, there is no danger"。</p> 
<p>Have a nice stay here.</p> 
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Alice</p>

<p>I'm so pleased to learn that you and your classmates are learning Chinese. I'd like to recommend the following two dictionaries. The English-Chinese/Chinese-English Dictionary is really a good one for beginners, It has 18 000 English words and 20 000 Chinese words. Besides plenty of examples, it has many notes telling you how to use a word, Xinhua Dictionary is the most popular Chinese dictionary, and it has a vocabulary of 10 000 words. It may also be useful to some advanced learners of Chinese. Of the two, ECCED is the more expensive, costing 52 yuan, and XD costs 11yuan.</p>

<p>你的好友因家境一般买不起名牌而闷闷不乐，给他写封信，谈谈你的看法和建议。</p>
<p>Dear Mr Xu,</p>
<p>I hope you are well now. No one will love you any less if you do  not  wear such expensive clothes. You are such a clever boy and always work hard at study. I'm sure you will have a promising future. Sometimes some people judge a person by the clothes  he wears, but time will soon prove they are wrong. Knowledge is beauty. It lasts longer and seems mush nicer than the clothes one wears. Who cares what Albert Einstein and Marie Curie were wearing when they won Nobel Prize？In my opinion, ciothes are part of life, not all. Please don't think too much of it, will you？</p>

<h3>参考答案：</h3>
<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>I read in a newspaper today that a "Learn Chinese, Sing Chinese Songs" Foreigners' Talent Show will be held in Beijing Television Station on July 18. I know you like singing, and you are in Beijing during that period. I think this is a good chance for you to show your singing talent, and how well you’ve learned Chinese. If you would like to try, you'll have to go to the TV station to sign up before the end of June. If there in anything I can do for you, I would be more than glad to help.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Li  Hua</p>

<p>男女应该平等吗?(Should Men and Women Be Equal?</p>
<h3>答案：</h3>
<p>Should Men and Women Be Equal？</p>                  
<p>People have different ideas this issue, Some people say that men are superior to women in ability because men are physically stronger, do most of the hard labor in the world and hold most important positions. Other people believe that women have the ability to compete with men. There have been many famous women state leaders and great scientists in the world. We should fully carry out the principle "to each according to his work" so that the enthusiasm of both men and women for work can be fully aroused.</p>
